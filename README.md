Cross Product Analysis: A Matlab project that calculates the cross product of any 2 vectors, measures the distance between each
vector, calculates the magnitude and illustrates a graph based on those values.

Getting Started: you will need to have MATLAB R2017 installed 


Deployment: Enter [x y z] coordinates for two vectors, once entered the calculated values should should be outputted onto the screen along with a beautiful graph to illustrate what was calculated.


Built With: MATLAB R2016a
Versioning: we used MATLAB R2016a provided by Florida Atlantic University
